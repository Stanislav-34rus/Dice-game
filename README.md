# Dice-game
Hello everyone. I want to publish my first project as part of learning JS. 
This is the simplest game imitating the throwing of two dice.
The task was the following:
--- Start the game with one button.
--- Self-stop enumeration of cubes.
--- In case of double dropout - display a message on the screen.
It was possible to implement these tasks using JS CSS and HTML.
